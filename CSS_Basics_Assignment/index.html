                <p>Did you know that a day on Venus is longer than its year? Venus takes about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis, meaning a single day there is incredibly lengthy. However, it only takes 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun, which means that while Venus completes a year, it's still not finished with one full rotation! This unique combination of slow rotation and faster orbit results in one of the strangest day-to-year relationships in our solar system. Plus, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, making its Sun rise in the west and set in the east!</p>
